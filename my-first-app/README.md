```

2. Install the dependencies:

To install the necessary dependencies for your GitHub repository project after cloning, follow these steps:

 a. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the official Node.js website.

 b. Open your project in an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or any text editor of your choice.

 c. Install the dependencies listed in the package.json file by running:
 
```
npm install 
```

This will install the necessary dependencies specified in the package.json file.

**Note:** If you encounter any issues during the installation process, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

### Running

To run the app, run the following commands:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the app and open it in your browser at http://localhost:3000. The page will automatically reload if you make any changes to the code. Any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### Building

To build the app for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will create an optimized production build of the app in the build folder. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is now ready to be deployed.
